# What is UISS?

UISS stands for UIKit Style Sheets.

UISS is an iOS library that provides you with a convenient way to define the style of your application.  
UISS is built on top of UIKit UIAppearance proxies.

# What UISS can do for you?

UISS has the power to:

* replace unreadable UIAppearance code with a simple JSON dictionary,
* provide a way to change application style without the need to rebuild your code, without the need to restart your app, even without the need to reload your views - yep, this is *the sexy* feature of UISS.

# Design goal

UISS do not enforce any dependencies on your app. You can generate Objective-C code for your UISS style so you do not even have to link with UISS library in your production build.

# But how does it really look like?

Assuming you're familiar with UIAppearance proxy you probably wrote a piece of code similar to this one:

```objc
[[UITabBar appearance] setTintColor:[UIColor darkGrayColor]]
```

in UISS it looks like this:

```json
{
    "UITabBar": {
        "tintColor": "darkGray",
    }
}
```

no big difference here, so lets look at more complex example:

**TODO**

# Install

* get the code
* add UISS.xcodeproj to your project
* (optional) add UISSResource.bundle to your target

## Configure UISS

### Local

The simplest way to start with UISS is to create `uiss.json` file and add it to your project's resources. To activate this file add this line:

```objc
[UISS configureWithDefaultJSONFile];
```

This should be called before your views are displayed, the common place for that is your Application Delegate's _didFinishLaunching_ method.

### Remote

If you want to load your style from remote location to enable live updates, here's how to do that:

	UISS *uiss = [[UISS alloc] init];
	uiss.style.url = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://your.awesome.domain/uiss.json"];
	[uiss load];

### Live updates

UISS can detect if your style changed and automatically update your interface. To enable this feature call this method:

```objc
[uiss enableAutoReloadWithTimeInterval:3];
```

### Status bar

```objc
    uiss.statusWindowEnabled = YES;
```

UISS will take a small portion of the screen (usually taken by status bar) to show you what is going on behind the scenes.

### Console

Tapping on UISS status bar will present console view where:

* you can get info about errors in your style
* you can generate UIAppearance code for your style

## Converters

UISS has value converters for every type used to set _UIAppearance_ properties. These converters provide useful shortcuts and convinient syntax for defining your properties.

Here are some examples and eqivalent values in _Objective-C_ code.

### Colors

#### Hex

	"#ffffff"
	[UIColor colorWithRed:255.0f green:255.0f blue:255.0f alpha:1]

#### Default UIColor colors

	"red"
	[UIColor redColor]

	"redColor"
	[UIColor redColor]

#### Colors with pattern image

	"patternImageName"
	[UIColor colorWithPatternImage:@"patternImageName"]

#### RGB

	[[0, 255, 255]]
	[UIColor colorWithRed:0.0f green:255.0f blue:255.0f alpha:1.0f]

#### Colors with alpha

	["#ffffff", 0.5]
	[UIColor colorWithRed:255.0f green:255.0f blue:255.0f alpha:.0.5f]

	["red", 0.5]
	[[UIColor redColor] colorWithAlphaComponent:0.5f]

	[0, 255, 255, 0.5]
	[UIColor colorWithRed:0.0f green:255.0f blue:255.0f alpha:.0.5f]

### Images

#### Simple image with name:

	"imageName"
	[UIImage imageNamed:@"imageName"]

#### Resizable images:

	["imageName", 1, 2, 3, 4]
	[[UIImage imageNamed:@"imageName"] resizableImageWithCapInsets:UIEdgeInsetsMake(1, 2, 3, 4)]

## Comments

JSON specification doesn't support comments. But sometimes being able to easly disable some parts of your UISS style can be really useful. You can do that by adding ```-``` prefix to dictionary keys. UISS will ignore those keys without reporting errors. Example:

	{
		"UIToolbar": {
			"-tintColor": "blue",
			"backgroundImage": ["background", "any", "default"]
		},
		"-UITabbar": {
			"tintColor": "blue"
		}
	}

This will only set _UIToolbar's_ background image.
